## Project Details

- Developed with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [Expo](https://expo.dev/)
- [Google Maps Platform](https://developers.google.com/maps) for geolocation
- Allows the user to create and store a list of defined locations with an associated image and description
- Home screen provides a list of user created locations with a clickable details screen
- Interactive map screen for viewing or selecting locations
- Persists data via [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)
- Automated address retrieval via reverse-geolocation
- Utilizes native camera, photo library, and map functionality
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) to manage location state
